# Sandbox for yarn registry

This repo is purely for educational reasons.

This is an example of a yarn project (`test_project` folder) that uses an offline mirror (`offline_mirror` folder).
To check how the example works, follow the next steps:
```bash
# do this offline
cd test_project
yarn install
# depedencies of the project will be downloaded in a node_modules folder
# ...with internet connection should work exactly the same.
```
